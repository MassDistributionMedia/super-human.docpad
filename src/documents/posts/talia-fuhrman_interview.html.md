I had the pleasure to interview Talia Fuhrman last week where we talked about her childhood growing up as the daughter of Joel Fuhrnman, author of 'Eat to Live' and appearing on 'Fat, Sick and nearly Dead' and a few other documentaries. We talk about the modern movement in America towards healthier living and a little about Talia's new book coming out in a year. Enjoy!
