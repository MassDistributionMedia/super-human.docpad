    <h1>Are you super-human?</h1>
    <div class="post-content"><p>To answer that we have to first define the word super. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>su·per<br>/ˈso͞opər/<br>Adjective<br>Very good or pleasant; excellent: &quot;Julie was a super girl&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a little vauge but we can use it. &quot;Very good&quot; as in &quot;You did a super job.&quot;, meaning &quot;You did a very good job.&quot; I&#39;d say that&#39;s a pretty nice compliment. Pleasant, &quot;You are pleasant to be with.&quot;, another good one to hear. Lastly, excellent. When I hear the word excellent it sounds similar phonically to accel, like accelerating, speeding up. The traditional understanding of the word excel means to surpass consistenty at something and to always be getting better at it. As if it came natural to you and you did it with ease, &quot;Your a natural at this&quot;. It&#39;s a word that feels like it&#39;s describing a bullet fast motion light a beam of light shooting out across the universe and never slowing down. &quot;It&#39;s a bird. It&#39;s a plane. It&#39;s you.&quot; </p>
<p>You&#39;ve been super before. Your super right now for reading this article about being super and inside of you is kinetic super-energy waiting to be used for good. Not just plain good though remember, super is very good. So what makes you super? What are you super at? What activates your super-human inside? Well if you are indeed a human, then a prerequisite and foundation is health. You can&#39;t be your super-self without you health. Let&#39;s use a fictional example of a image of extremely poor health, a zombie. They are slow, can&#39;t think at all and they get hacked down by the hundreds as a burden. Opposite on the spectrum, a image of finctional perfect health is Superman or Superwoman. They are &quot;very good&quot; about their intentions. They are pleasant kind people to interect with and most of all, they are excellent! They are fast, strong, couragous and confident in themselves. </p>
<p>Now can you see Superman sitting down eating a greesy Big Mac? I mean I think he could survive it of course but the image isn&#39;t fitting. What about the zombie, can you see a zombie eatting a rotten cheesburger? The zombie/burger image is much more fitting. Superman is better fitted drinking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrosia">abrosia</a>, &quot;the nectar of the gods&quot;, which is thought to be honey. Certain quality honeys are considered super-foods. The following is from: <a href="http://apitherapy.blogspot.com/2012/01/beekeepers-have-low-incidence-of-cancer.html">http://apitherapy.blogspot.com/2012/01/beekeepers-have-low-incidence-of-cancer.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Till date, no study has faulted the fact that beekeepers have very low, almost negligible incidence of cancer worldwide. Due to the weight of this fact and coupled with his experience, John Anderson, Professor of beekeeping, University of Aberdeen, unequivocally declared: “Keep bees and eat honey if you want to live long. Beekeepers live longer than anyone else”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait, back up a little, &quot;What&#39;s a super-food&quot;? There is no legal definition for the word but </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Oxford English Dictionary[4] includes citations for superfood in the general sense of &quot;a food considered especially nutritious or otherwise beneficial to health and well-being,&quot; dating from 1915 &amp; 1949
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfood">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfood</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Especially&quot;, phonically kind of sounds like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanglish">Spanglish</a> for the word special. So then these super-foods are special. They stand out. They are just really really healthy for you. These are the foods Superman would eat if he had to. Granted the term has been hyped as a new marketing term, but the classic super-foods as described by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wolfe_(raw_foodist">David Wolfe (raw foodiest)</a>):</p>

<p>So is it really as simple as changing our diets to super-food smoothies and fresh foods for us to turn into super-humans? It is. One of the most simple, yet powerful changes you could ever make in your life. Shop at the farmers market. Get fresh vegetables and fruits and make some fresh smoothies. Beans and rice make a complete protein and their cheap! Add some herbs &amp; spices and your off. It&#39;s not a diet. Diet&#39;s don&#39;t work. Notice they have the word &quot;die&quot; in them, &quot;die·t&quot;. Instead do as David Wolfe says and simply add healthy things to what you eat, like a super-food smoothie. There are hundreds of green &amp; super-food smoothie recipies avaiable for free online right now and so there is no excuse for you to start excelling as a super-human. </p>
<p><strong>This is your drive. This is your moment. Don&#39;t be a zombie. Be Superman and Superwoman. Be super. Your worth it.</strong></p>
